# 06--Weather-Dashboard

The search bar will add any city searched that exists in the weather api database. Those buttons can be clicked and will display the current weather and a five day forecast.

I loaded in moment to give the time and get some practice with using multiple databases in one place.

I noticed that the UV index didn't work for one of the cities I put in because that information isn't available in that city, but the page still functions without that info.

I styled the page entirely with Bootstrap. I have no style sheet.
